### Welcome :)

My name is **Jordan Lin**. I am a fourth-year Computer Science major and Mathematics minor at UCLA. Check out my website [here](https://kuanhenglin.github.io)!

My research interests stem from **generative models** to topics such as computer vision, multimodal generation, controllable generation, interpretability, image processing, biomedical imaging, and optimization. Particularly, my work revolves around pushing the boundaries and applications of large generative models to allow us to interact with them in a more **human** way.
